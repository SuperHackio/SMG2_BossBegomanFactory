# SMG2 BossBegomanFactory
### Topmaniac in SMG2

This is an enhanced port of Topmaniac from Super Mario Galaxy. It includes new SMG2 specific features while still being faithful to the original.

Below is a list of everything included:
- The ObjectData archives for Topmaniac.
- The "BossBegoman" object in the editor
- An edited ActionSound.arc file that includes edits that were made to ActionSound
- An edited Effect.arc file that includes particle effects for all included objects

Below is a list of other things that you will need:
- A level editor

The setup for Topmaniac is not the same that it is in SMG1.
